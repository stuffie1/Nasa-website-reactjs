    <p className='text-dark'>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star, often referred to as a G dwarf star, located at the center of our solar system. Comprising primarily hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%), it has a diameter of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles) and a mass 333,000 times that of Earth. With a core temperature of around 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), the Sun's nuclear fusion processes release immense energy, making it shine.

The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and is expected to continue its current phase for another 5 billion years. It sustains life on Earth by providing light and heat, driving the planet's climate. Notable solar activities include solar flares and sunspots, while the Sun constantly emits a solar windâ€”a stream of charged particles that extends throughout the solar system. As the gravitational center of our solar system, the Sun influences the orbits of all planets, including Earth. Scientists study the Sun to understand stellar processes and fundamental cosmic forces.</p>
